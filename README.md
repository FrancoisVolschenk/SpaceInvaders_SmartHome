# What The Project is About
This project was started as part of a team building exercise for the Space Invaders team at Entelect. The idea behind this project is to have fun learning about electronics and microcontrollers while doing some good ol' tem building. 

## The Smart Home
The aim of the project is to build a miniature scale smart home using cardboard boxes to represent the rooms. Several small electronics components make up the electrical system of the house such as LEDs for lights, a distance sensor in the "garage" as a way to indocate how close the car is to the wall, and motion sensors outside as a security system. All of these are controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller to allow the home's inhabitants to control all of these electronics from a web page on their phone.

## What's been done so far
- The Pico has been set up to connect to a wifi network
- The Pico has been set up to serve a web page
- Lights have been connected in the various rooms
- A web page has been created with buttons to control the lights
- A rave feature was added to flash colourful lights around the entire house
- A lumos feature to turn on all lights
- A Knox feature to turn off all lights
